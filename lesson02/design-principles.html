            <h3> White Space</h3>

            <p>Microsoft</p>
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-za">microsoft.com</a>

                White space (or negative space) is the only one that specifically deals with what you don’t add. White space is exactly that—the empty page around the elements in your composition. For beginning designers it can be a perilous zone. Often simply giving a composition more room to breathe can upgrade it from mediocre to successful.

            <h3> Contrast</h3>

            <p>Coca-Cola</p>
            <a href="https://www.coca-cola.com/za/en">Coca-Cola.com</a>

            <p>
                Contrast is what people mean when they say a design “pops.” It comes away from the page and sticks in your memory. Contrast creates space and difference between elements in your design. Your background needs to be significantly different from the color of your elements so they work harmoniously together and are readable.

            <h3> Repetition</h3>

            <p>Amazon</p>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">amazon.com</a>
            <img src="images/amazon.jpg" alt="amazon-image" height="500" width="250">
            <p>
                
                Repetition can be important beyond one printed product. Anyone thinking about a startup knows one of the first things you need is a strong logo to feature on your website, business cards, social media and more. Brand identity? Another term for repetition.
